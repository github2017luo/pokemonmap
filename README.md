Pokemon Go GPS cheating and Pokemon Map - an app help you search Pokemon, PokeStop and Gym and show on the map, you can move around the map by using keyboard, drag drop your marker, click to Pokemon, PokeStop, Gym. Your location will be send to Pokemon Go app in Genymotion immediately.

I get the Pokemon location data direclty from www.pokecrew.com, and PokeStop, Gym location data directly from www.pokemon-map.com (quite slow). So the app will stop working whenever they change their api.

This app was built by Electron. Check youtube link https://youtu.be/qtJFMa8wUVc?list=PLepuEZcdKax-IT4DvLY8KXiu_xtDYzt4s to see how it works.

How to run and build the code:

- For first time: 
	+ npm install (so you need npm, google for it :) )
	+ update Genymotion Shell file path in index.html
	+ update Google Map api key in index.html
- From second time: npm start
- If you want to output binary files to run on Linux, Windows, or Mac: npm run-script package, the output files will be put in 'build' folder

If you are gamers, don't want to do above stuffs, just contact me, I will send you download links (now I don't have :) ).
Have fun!
